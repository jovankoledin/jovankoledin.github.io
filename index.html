    <h2> Favorite Mac Miller Lyrics: </h2>
        <ul>
          <blockquote>    - It's right now, fuck forever, we right here, rain clouds come before the sky get clear </blockquote>
          <blockquote>    - Yo, Mr. Jobs, you see I'm a Mac, but I'm rollin' deep like Adele </blockquote>
          <blockquote>    - They gonna try to tell you no, shatter all your dreams, but you gotta get up and go, and think of better things </blockquote>
          <blockquote>    - No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile </blockquote>
          <blockquote> <br> </blockquote>
        </ul>
