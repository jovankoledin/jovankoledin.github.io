    <h2> Favorite Mac Miller Lyrics: </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't go back on my word, yeah I keep that shit gift wrapped</li>
      <li>Yo, Mr. Jobs, you see I'm a Mac, But I'm rollin' deep like Adele</li>
      <li>They gonna try to tell you no, shatter all your dreams, but you gotta get up and go, and think of better things</li>
      <li>No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile</li>
    </ul>
</body>
